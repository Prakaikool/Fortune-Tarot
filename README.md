# Fortune Tarot

A **Vue.js** application where users can draw three random tarot cards to gain insight into their past, present, and future. The project also includes a **searchable library** of all tarot cards and their meanings.

I created this project to help people easily explore tarot cards online, get quick readings, and dive deeper into the symbolic meanings behind each card.
